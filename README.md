# EnvironAI
This was the first implementation of TensorFlow to develop an AI algorithm for image detection of whether an item is garbage, recycling, or compost for a startup I worked on, EnvironAI.
EnvironAI was an AI powered waste management and scheduling platform. This platform uses AI image recognition enabling users to photograph an item to receive instructions on how to dispose of it.
